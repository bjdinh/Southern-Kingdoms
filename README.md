Explanation:
  Players start in the lobby and take the portal to level 1,
  People go around and complete dungeons or PvP,
  After X minutes the 'Temple' of that level will start a beacon and the portal to the next level,
  Per level the dungeons will become more vicious and hard to complete,
  The idea is to get to level 5 and defeat the Obsidian Fortress,
  The first player to get to the Eye of Obsidian wins (top of the Obsidian Fortress,
  If you rush you wont have good enough gear to defeat the Obsidian Fortress. If you wait to long another will defeat it,
  Timing is Important,
  Every 10 minutes a Legendary item will be spawned on Craaaaaaaaaaazy Treasure island, (Ledgendary Rush)
